# AstroStudy

A recreation of my A Level Computing coursework in Java, originally built using VB.NET and Windows
Forms.

My original [final report](doc/report.pdf) can be found in the `/doc` folder, which was developed
from 2019-2020 and earned a final grade of 72/75 (96%).

I decided to rebuild this project using JavaFX to gain more experience with the framework and build
on my Java skills, but also to see how I would improve on the code I wrote the first time.

One key change I have made is to tailor this project to general knowledge, rather than astrophysics
as it was originally intended.
